# Intro
This repository serves to host all my Python3 & C++ implementations of the algorithms and data structures covered in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/boulder-data-structures-algorithms"> CU Boulder's Coursera DS&A Specialization </a>

In order to solidfy my own understanding of the content, I will periodically keep on updating the README with my notes on the data structure/algorithm covered most recently.
